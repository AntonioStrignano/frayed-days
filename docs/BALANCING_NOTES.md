# Balancing Notes
Initial placeholder numbers; iterate after first playtest.

## Resource Target Ranges (Early Run)
- Growth: +6 to +15 per successful challenge.
- Monotony: +2 to +6 for shortcuts / challenge baseline; aim keep <50 by mid-run if diversified.
- Comfort: Gains 4–8 via support/comfort; spend 3–5 on reflection.
- Debt: Placeholder (erosion) not yet meaningfully used.

## Depth Formula
`depth = growth - (monotony + debt)`
Winning trajectory: depth trending positive by run ~6.

## Burnout
- Threshold consecutive successes: 3 (accessory can raise).
- Penalty multiplier: 0.8 (reduce growth gain).

## Degradation Thresholds (config driven)
- Fresh: <25 monotony OR ratio <0.2
- Dulling: >=25
- Faded: >=50
- Sterile: >=75
Adjust alongside shortcut pattern ratio interplay.

## Reflection Costs
- Tier1: 3 comfort
- Tier2: 5 comfort (cumulative spend ~8 to reach tier2 after two fails)

## Fragment Drop Rate
- Memory base success: 10% (placeholder)
- Others: 0% currently (focus test memory first)

## Open Balancing Questions
- Should shortcuts occasionally add debt instead of monotony for variety?
- Scale comfort cost with puzzle tier? (defer)
- Add diminishing returns to consecutive comfort nodes? (monotony bonus already partially covers)\
