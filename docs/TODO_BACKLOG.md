# Backlog (Beyond Initial Core)
Core loop baseline complete when: all puzzle archetypes base tier, reflection, degradation visible.

## Short Term Enhancements
- Token effects variety (currently placeholder growth modifiers).
- Accessory effect application layer (currently data only, not applied in code).
- Distinct UI feedback per degradation tier (palette swap + text style).
- Forced comfort day trigger when burnout persists 2 days.
- Shop cost reveal toggle (optional UI conceal).

## Medium Term
- Puzzle difficulty scaling to intermediate/advanced tiers selection rules.
- Fragment collection completion bonus (depth multiplier?).
- Depth end-run evaluation branches: Growth ending vs Routine lock cinematic.
- Wildcard points sink (convert to fragment reroll?).
- Pact UI confirmation / decline.

## Technical Debt
- Central random helper for seed reproducibility.
- Replace stub puzzle RNG outcomes with actual scene interactions.
- Unit test-like scripts for delta application consistency.

## Nice To Have Later
- Localization pipeline (string richness states aware).
- Analytics abstraction for logger export.
