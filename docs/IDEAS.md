# Frayed Days – Idea Parking Lot
(Keep within declared scope; reject feature creep.)

## Narrative / Tone Hooks
- Color draining metaphor: saturation = meaning.
- NPC micro-vignettes react to monotony tier (text richness gating).
- Fragments assemble a poem / mosaic (soft ending variant if partial set).

## Potential Future (Defer Now)
- Skill tree (growth coin sinks) – placeholder only.
- Dynamic soundtrack layering beyond 4 tiers.
- Accessibility: alternate input for timing puzzle.
- Multiple burnout types (cognitive / emotional) with different penalties.

## Maybe Later (Need Justification)
- Weekly meta-events after N days.
- Rare “Insight” node: converts wildcard points to permanent fragment slot.
- Social chain bonuses (support -> comfort -> challenge buff) if diversified.

## Explicitly Out (Per Spec)
- Combat, physics complexity, procedural generation, inventories.
- New resource types not listed.
- AI companions or pathfinding.

## Notes
Keep each added idea tagged with: [FUTURE], [DEFER], [OUT]. Use PR reviews to enforce.
