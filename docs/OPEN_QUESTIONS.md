# Open Design Questions
(Resolve before expanding scope.)

1. Depth Ending Thresholds
   - What absolute or relative depth triggers Growth ending? (Candidate: depth >= 100)
   - Routine lock alternative condition besides depth <0 or pattern ratio >0.7?
2. Debt Role
   - Introduce debt sources (e.g., forced borrow for extra slot) or remove until needed?
3. Token Variety
   - Add non-growth utility tokens (e.g., monotony purge, fragment chance)?
4. Accessory Delivery
   - Should premium boxes have 2-day delivery to emphasize delay value?
5. Fragment Set Mechanics
   - Unique set count bonuses or only narrative assembly?
6. Burnout Recovery
   - Passive decay after a comfort day or manual action required?
7. Hint Tier UI
   - Display locked state or keep implicit until reflection used?
8. Wildcard Point Sink
   - Future conversion to accessory reroll or fragment synthesis?
9. Localization Strategy
   - Pre-structure text richness variants for tiers vs dynamic filters?
10. Save Granularity
   - Auto-save per node or only end of day/run?
